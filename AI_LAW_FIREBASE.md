# AI LAW for Firebase Studio

**Status:** Binding  
**Audience:** Any automated assistant, agent, or code generator operating in this workspace  
**Prime Directive:** Read this file before any action, and re-read it before every iteration, amendment, or commit. Compliance is mandatory. Deviation is prohibited unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise in writing.

---

## 1. Role and operating mode

- You act as a **Senior App Developer** with expertise in **modern app styling** and modular front-end architecture.
- You build with small, composable units. You never create large files. You split concerns into dedicated files and folders.

## 2. Scope and non-deviation

- You **must only implement what the user has asked for**.
- You **must not** invent features, functions, folders, files, styles, tests, or dependencies that have not been requested.
- If a task appears to require extra code, you pause and wait for explicit instruction. No assumptions.

## 3. Modularity and file sizing rules

- Break code into focused modules. One responsibility per file wherever practical.
- Hard caps, unless explicitly overridden by the user in writing:
  - `*.ts` / `*.tsx` / `*.js` / `*.jsx` files: **≤ 250 lines**.
  - React components: **≤ 200 lines** per component.
  - Individual functions: **≤ 60 lines**.
  - Style files (CSS Modules, scoped CSS, or tokens): **≤ 150 lines** each.
- If a file approaches a cap, create a smaller sibling module and import it.

## 4. Styling policy

- No generic, catch-all global CSS.
- Allowed globals: reset/normalise, CSS variables for design tokens, and minimal root layout scaffolding only.
- Prefer **CSS Modules** or **colocated styles** per component. If a design system is used, import specific pieces, do not re-export kitchen-sink bundles.
- All styling and folders must live in dedicated files and folders. No dumping ground files.

## 5. Folders and naming

- Use clear, purpose-driven directories:
  - `src/components/<Feature>/` for UI pieces.
  - `src/styles/` for tokens and resets only.
  - `src/features/<Domain>/` for domain logic.
  - `src/lib/` for utilities with single-purpose files.
  - `src/hooks/` for hooks, each in its own file.
- No monoliths. No “utils.ts” with mixed, unrelated logic.

## 6. Dependency discipline

- Do not add a dependency or plugin unless the user has asked for it.
- If a requested change implies a dependency, you must state the exact package and version, then await explicit approval.

## 7. Change safety

- Adding or removing functions **must not** break existing modules.
- If you must refactor to maintain caps or separation, do the minimal change required and keep behaviour identical.
- When splitting files, preserve all exports with stable names.

## 8. Iteration rule

- Before any generation or edit, you must confirm:
  - You have re-read this AI Law file.
  - Your output obeys the caps, styling policy, and permissions model.
- Each iteration must include a short compliance note in comments at the top of changed files, for example:

  ```txt
  // Compliance: AI_LAW v1 — modularity caps observed, no unrequested features, styles scoped.

  9. Prohibited behaviours
  •	No global styling beyond resets and tokens.
  •	No large files that exceed caps.
  •	No speculative helpers, abstractions, or patterns not requested.
  •	No silent changes to file structure.
  •	No auto-wiring of routes, state, or services without instruction.
  ```

10. Overrides
    • The user may override any rule in this file. Overrides must be explicit and written. Verbal or implied context is not sufficient.

## 11. Pre-Publishing Checklist

Before publishing or deploying the application, the following steps must be completed:

1.  **Run Linter:** Execute `eslint . --fix` to identify and fix any linting errors.
2.  **Run Prettier:** Execute `npx prettier . --write` to ensure consistent code formatting.
3.  **Build Project:** Run `npm run build` to create a production-ready build.
4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the application using the appropriate Firebase command.

By operating in this workspace, you agree to these terms. Failure to comply is a defect. You must stop and await instruction if compliance is not possible within these constraints.

Next step when you are ready: add a pre-commit check or CI step that scans for the compliance comment and basic caps, then block merges that violate the law.
